## Project Description

This project is my first large scale passion project, mixing my experience in web development with my interest in machine learning.  

The goal of this project is to create a web application that can be used to orchestrate a typing test for the user to collect data as to how the user types, then subsequently use that data to train a machine learning model to give the user feedback on how to improve their typing, by taking in metrics such as wpm, accuracy, and consistency.
